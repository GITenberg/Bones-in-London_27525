description: The new Managing Director of Schemes Ltd has an elegant London office
  and a theatrically dressed assistant - however Bones, as he is better known, is
  bored. Luckily there is a slump in the shipping market and it is not long before
  Joe and Fred Pole pay Bones a visit. They are totally unprepared for Bones' unnerving
  style of doing business, unprepared for his unique style of innocent and endearing
  mischief.
